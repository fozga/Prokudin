# Grid Overlay Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a rule-of-thirds grid overlay to the image display that helps with composition. The grid divides the image into 9 equal parts using 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines. In crop mode, the grid is visible only within the selected crop area and updates dynamically as the user modifies the crop. Outside crop mode, the grid is visible on the entire displayed preview.

## Changes Made

### 1. New File: `src/widgets/grid_overlay.py`
Created a dedicated class to manage and draw the grid overlay.

**Features:**
- `GridOverlay` class with configurable grid settings
- Rule-of-thirds grid (2 vertical and 2 horizontal lines)
- Lines positioned at 1/3 and 2/3 of the image dimensions
- Semi-transparent white lines (128/255 opacity)
- 3-pixel line width for good visibility
- Support for both QRect and QRectF rectangle types

**Key Methods:**
- `__init__()` - Initializes grid with default settings (enabled, white color, 3px width, solid lines, 128 opacity)
- `set_enabled(enabled)` - Enable/disable grid display
- `set_color(color)` - Set grid line color
- `set_line_width(width)` - Set grid line width (1-10 pixels)
- `set_line_style(style)` - Set line style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.)
- `set_opacity(opacity)` - Set transparency (0-255)
- `draw(painter, rect)` - Main drawing method that calculates and draws grid lines
- `_calculate_grid_lines(rect)` - Calculates horizontal and vertical line positions
- `_draw_grid_lines(painter, h_lines, v_lines)` - Draws the actual lines

**Design:**
- Lines are drawn at exactly 1/3 and 2/3 positions for rule-of-thirds composition
- Uses QPainter for efficient rendering
- Configurable properties allow future UI controls if needed
- Works in both scene coordinates and viewport coordinates

### 2. Modified: `src/widgets/image_viewer.py`

#### Imports
- Added import for `GridOverlay` class

#### Constructor Changes
- Added `self.grid_overlay = GridOverlay()` to initialize grid overlay instance

#### Modified Method: `drawForeground()`
Enhanced the foreground drawing method to include grid overlay:

**Changes:**
1. Added grid drawing for non-crop mode:
   - Gets the visible scene rectangle (`self.mapToScene(self.viewport().rect()).boundingRect()`)
   - Draws grid overlay on entire visible preview area
   - Grid updates automatically when user zooms or pans

**Behavior:**
- Grid is drawn on top of the image but below crop rectangle
- Grid automatically scales with zoom level
- Grid follows pan operations
- Grid remains visible during all image adjustments (brightness, contrast, etc.)

### 3. Modified: `src/widgets/crop_handler.py`

#### Constructor Changes
- Added `self.grid_overlay = GridOverlay()` to initialize grid overlay instance for crop mode

#### Modified Method: `draw_foreground()`
Enhanced the crop mode drawing to include grid within crop rectangle:

**Changes:**
1. Added grid drawing within crop rectangle:
   - Checks if crop rectangle exists and is valid
   - Draws grid overlay only within the selected crop area
   - Grid is clipped to crop rectangle boundaries

**Behavior:**
- Grid appears only inside the crop selection
- Grid updates in real-time as user drags crop rectangle
- Grid updates when user resizes crop rectangle
- Grid scales with the crop area dimensions
- Grid maintains 1/3 and 2/3 divisions within the crop bounds

## Technical Details

### Coordinate System
- Grid uses scene coordinates for consistency
- Automatically transforms between viewport and scene coordinates
- Works correctly with zoom and pan operations

### Drawing Order
1. Base image (background)
2. Grid overlay (foreground)
3. Crop rectangle (foreground, in crop mode)
4. Crop handles (foreground, in crop mode)

### Performance
- Grid is redrawn only when necessary (pan, zoom, crop changes)
- Uses efficient QPainter drawing methods
- Minimal performance impact

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- Semi-transparent white lines for good visibility on most images
- 3-pixel line width makes lines clearly visible without being obtrusive
- Grid helps with rule-of-thirds composition technique

### Behavior in Different Modes
1. **Normal Mode (no crop):**
   - Grid covers entire visible preview area
   - Grid scales with zoom
   - Grid moves with pan

2. **Crop Mode:**
   - Grid appears only within crop rectangle
   - Grid updates in real-time during crop adjustments
   - Grid helps align composition within the crop area
   - Grid disappears outside crop boundaries

### Integration
- Grid is always enabled by default
- Grid works seamlessly with existing features:
  - Image loading
  - Channel switching
  - RGB combined view
  - Brightness/contrast/intensity adjustments
  - Zoom and pan operations
  - Crop mode

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future versions:
- UI toggle button to enable/disable grid
- Grid color customization
- Grid line width adjustment
- Alternative grid patterns (golden ratio, center lines, etc.)
- Grid visibility based on zoom level
- Keyboard shortcut to toggle grid

## Dependencies
- PyQt5.QtCore (QRect, QRectF, Qt)
- PyQt5.QtGui (QColor, QPainter, QPen)

## Testing
