    Aligns green and blue channels to the red channel using ORB feature matching
    and affine transformation. Uses grayscale images for feature detection and
    applies the same transformations to both grayscale and RGB images.

    Args:
        grayscale_images (list of numpy.ndarray): List of three grayscale images (R, G, B), each as a 2D numpy array.
        rgb_images (list of numpy.ndarray): List of three RGB images corresponding to the grayscale images.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - list of numpy.ndarray: List of aligned grayscale images [R, G, B]
            - list of numpy.ndarray: List of aligned RGB images [R, G, B]

    Raises:
        AlignmentError: If alignment fails due to insufficient matches or transformation errors.
