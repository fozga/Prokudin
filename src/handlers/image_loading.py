    """
    Opens a file dialog for the user to select a Sony ARW RAW image,
    loads the image using rawpy, and processes it to an 8-bit RGB image.

    Args:
        parent (QWidget): The parent widget for the QFileDialog (typically the main window).

    Returns:
        tuple: Either (numpy.ndarray, None) with the 3D RGB image as a NumPy array
        (dtype=uint8, shape: HxWx3) and no error, or (None, str) with an error message
        if loading fails or is cancelled.

    Workflow:
        1. Opens a QFileDialog for ARW file selection.
        2. Loads the selected file with rawpy and applies camera white balance.
        3. Disables automatic brightness correction, outputs 8 bits per sample.
        4. Returns the RGB image directly for further processing.
        5. Handles errors gracefully, returning None and an error message.

    Example:
        rgb_image, error = load_raw_image(self)
        if error:
            print(error)
        elif rgb_image is not None:
            # Convert to grayscale if needed
            gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(rgb_image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
            # Proceed with processing
